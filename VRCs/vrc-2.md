| VRC-2 | DLP Performance Metrics | Draft | Technical | anna, kahtaf, eduard | 2025-01-01 |

## Abstract

This VRC proposes introducing unique wallet contributions with verified data as a performance metric for DLP rankings and rewards.  The proposal introduces a scoring system that accounts for 20% of a DLPâ€™s total score, while maintaining the existing staking metric at 80%. This change aims to incentivize broader participation and higher-quality data contributions within DLPs.

## Motivation

The current DLP ranking system relies solely on staked VANA amounts, which may not fully capture the health and activity of a DLP. By incorporating unique wallet contributions:

1. DLPs are incentivized to foster broader participation rather than depending on a few large stakeholders.
2. Active data contribution and verification become key performance indicators.
3. The system better reflects both financial commitment (staking) and operational activity (data contributions).

## Specification
